----------------------------------------

Realty plugin allows you to create your fully functional real estate website with a single plugin. The admin panel functionality is easy to use and loaded with features. Presently, you can choose from two plugin versions â€“ Realty Free and Realty Pro. With the first one, you get all the basic functionality that is perfectly balanced and easy to use as is. However, if you are in search of extra features that would allow you to cover more specific realty aspects on your website, such as an ability to create Agents, or add Features to the Properties you created, the Pro plugin version will come in handy.
